%Previous chapters have described the work that has been done on WuKong platform.
%It is useful to reflect on what has been accomplished and place them in the
%broader context of the more general fault tolerance problem as well as the
%specific contributions of this work.

\section{Discussion}

We have presented a fault tolerance primitive for WuKong that is able to
configure itself based on user policy and requirements. We have described strip,
          a redundancy abstraction for service peers. We also described the
          reconfigurable redundancy architecture with distributed algorithms
          that synchronize strip view across network and perform network
          reconfiguration for the replaced services. It was shown in experiments
          that our approach is capable of failover in a small network.

The developed methods add new and useful solutions to build a fault tolerant
primitive that could be reasoned easily and with a performance under
expectation. Our system provides an extension to other solutions in terms of
completeness and complexity. It serves as a quick and easy solution to provide
practical failover for service-oriented applications.

% TODO: summarize the results of the experiments here
% e.g. The solutions developed for WuKong system performs very consistently, as
% the recovery time is always under two secs on average with a handful of
% sensors. However, occasionally heartbeats could report erroneous failures and
% result in a quick false recovery, and left the partitioned nodes behind, but
% the system as a whole still function properly.


\section{Future Work}

% Probably move it to future work? Probably don't do it.
%Of course there are a lot of room for improvements. For example, if we want to
%go beyond this limitation of 232 nodes by Zwave, one of the ways we could do is
%to build another Zwave network and have a routing agent to route messages
%between networks. And we would also want to handle network partitions. One of
%the possible research directions is to merge the partitions back to one if they
%come back together, or by using some arbitrary flags to indicate primary
%components in the network to eliminate redundant commanding network components.
%Nonetheless, it is also an opportunity to look into multi-hop networks since
%heartbeats protocols are designed with single-hop network in mind, whether we
%could change the protocol to handle multi-hop is also a big challenge a future
%research could take on.


We have shown a design for a fault tolerance primitive for WuKong
in which system could be configured based on user requirements, strips makes it
really easy to describe a component system with redundancy for heterogeneous
services and devices, and the reconfigurable redundancy architecture ensure
consistency after services recovery. Nevertheless, there is still room for
improvements. This section will address some directions future research can
take.

This study did not consider network partition. Network partition occurs when
a network of nodes got partitioned into two subnetworks where none can detect
each other for a period of time, but none of the nodes were dead. In this thesis
we assumed fail-stop failures where nodes, once dead, will not come back;
therefore, when network partition occurred, each part of the network would not
be able to recognize each other and would cause conflicts and confusions.  Our
current heartbeat protocol is decentralized and easy to construct, but it is not
shown to work under networks where messages are sent in multiple hops, since
algorithms used to produce heartbeat protocol arrangement does not consider
topology of the network. Heartbeat, by its nature, is sensitive to delay, so if
a heartbeat message was not received within tolerance period, under the current
implementation, the node would be suspected of failure and was assumed dead
forever. However, if the node was still alive, since the revived nodes was
treated as if it was dead, it would create an artificial network isolation, and
that is a network partition. One of the possible directions is to create a more
sophisticated failure model or heartbeat protocol that could handle network
partition.

Current implmentation can only allow the detector to handle one failure at
a time. It would be a desirable future research direction to investigate
handling consecutive node failures. One possible way is by storing strips and
heartbeat protocol data from nodes ahead, such that when consecutive nodes
failure occurred the detector would be able to recover those services it backed
up.  However there is a tradeoff on the memory a node could store and the number
of consecutive node failures a network could handle.

The optimization problem for application deployment is also an important element
in this system. This thesis didn't consider finding a optimal deployment for the
level of redundancy specified in the user policy. The problem of deploying
a specific distributed system onto a network structure typically consists of
mapping the components of the system onto the hosts of the network. The mapping
is subject to constraints. The constraints could be whether a node supports
certain service to host certain components, and how much communication overhead
would induce from the assignment to maintain consistency for the strips, and
from the perspective of WuKong, some components need to separate from other
components to achieve fault tolerance, and some needs to place together to
function properly.  Determining such an optimal deployment is a combinatorial
optimization problem, and combinatorial optimization problems generally
extremely challenging computationally. It is unlikely that a single approach
will be effective on all problems or instances of the same problems. As we also
want the system to come up with a solution within a time limit. So finding
a good balance between the quality of a solution of the time it takes to come up
with a good enough solution is critical.
