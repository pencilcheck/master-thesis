\paragraph{Policy}

% talk briefly about policy, what it is, why it is important, give some examples if possible

When application are getting complex full with features and configurations, 
it is important to have a high level declarative configuration policy language 
to specify the control for features and control of their respective behaviors 
smoothly. I propose a high level policy for fault tolerance that could be
translated to low level application requirements.
