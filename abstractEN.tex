As the variety of sensors and actuators increase, applications for distributed systems are getting more complex. Repairment becomes difficult to perform manually. It is appealing to design a system that could achieve fault tolerance without require human intervention.

This thesis investigated this problem. There are many different techniques exist to solve this problem under different assumptions with varying guarantees, what works best for one instance of a problem does not always apply to the others. This thesis proposed a new technique to solve the problem under the assumption of stateless application and heterogeneous network with a varity of hardware specifications where some nodes could perform multiple services at a time. The technique we proposed does not require any strong message ordering properties, and it requires only linear message complexity

% Do I need to describe what this thesis will present??
