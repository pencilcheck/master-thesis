%\textbf{Enabled failover for M2M platforms in a distributed manner}
\noindent Failover for service-oriented distributed networks is a prerequisite
to enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the sense of “deploy-once, run forever.”
Resource reconfiguration is required to achieve failover mechanisms upon
replacement of devices or failure of services. It can be particularly
challenging when services in applications have more than end-to-end
transmissions between devices that are heterogeneous or versatile, for which
duplications can be costly and redundant. Specifically, a device with a failed
service shall be taken over by another service peer, instead of a device
counterpart to recover application as a whole. Strip is introduced to store
a list of duplicated services, and, each service peer
maintains a consistent view of strips. In combination with the heartbeat
protocol which was widely applied for failure detection, recovery from failure
can be achieved by manipulating strips in a distributed manner, without
a centralized repository. Experiments using Arduino Mega 2560 compatible devices
show that our approach is capable of failover in small networks, whereas
experiments in larger networks are underway. Future research directions include
addressing the scalability issue, network partitions and tackling simultaneous
failures.
