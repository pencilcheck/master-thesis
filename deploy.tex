Niels:about the tradeoffs in determining the deployment from your fault
tolerance perspective

\section{Reconfigurable Atomic Service for Component Object}

\begin{comment}
Niels suggested that I show that I am aware of such issue with determining
optimality for deployment which is not clear for WuKong yet, there are many
ways or metrics to optimize for, all I can do in this work is to identify some
tradeoffs certain deployment for fault tolerance could influence the system
with certain metrics.

Limits will be hard to define here
